This document has a dump of "potential" TODOs, many are likely to be bad ideas.

# Use 3.14 template format?

```
# New t-string approach - deferred evaluation
template = t"Hello, {name}!"  # Creates a template, doesn't evaluate yet

# Now we can reuse this template with different contexts
context1 = {"name": "Bob"}
context2 = {"name": "Charlie"}

print(template.substitute(context1))  # Hello, Bob!
print(template.substitute(context2))  # Hello, Charlie!
```

# Small TODOs

 check_equivalence should have a "top" argument (multiple modules)
   Fix v2chisel to pass as argument

 Fix all the llm_wrap calls/configs
 Create class to extract code from markdown from text and return in list

## Guardrails

 Many prompts can have questions/answers that go off-topic. A simple guardrail for user prompt makes sense.

## CompileBugFix

 + Use a DB with one-shot sample fixes.
 + Insert markers in comments for location (or region if unclear).
 + Provide specification if existing too
 + Iterate over several LLMs and mixes/prompts for cost saving and speed.

## RungimeBugFix

 There are several degrees of feedback that can be passed to fix a bug. Providing all is not always the best https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905
