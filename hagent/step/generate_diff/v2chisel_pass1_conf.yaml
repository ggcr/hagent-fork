        You are a coding assistant to update Chisel code based on differences between two Verilog versions.

        I have a Scala program that generates Verilog. I made modifications to the Verilog code and now need to update the corresponding Chisel code.

        The fixed Verilog represents the desired changes. Here is the unified diff between the original and fixed Verilog:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        here is the original chisel code:
        ```
        {chisel_original}
        ```
        Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work? 
        Output *only* the diff in **unified diff format** with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff, **unified diff format**

        I also provide a subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:

        {chisel_subset}
        ```

        The previous attempt to generate a Chisel diff did not produce valid Verilog. 
        This is the currect chisel_diff:

        The previous attempt to generate a Chisel diff did not produce valid Verilog. 
        This is the current chisel_diff:

        {chisel_diff}

        I am providing a revised subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking additional lines that might need changes:
        ```
