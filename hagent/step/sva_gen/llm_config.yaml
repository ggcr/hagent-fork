        You are a professional VLSI specification and RTL code analyzer. When I ask for information on an input, output, or internal register and logic signal, please extract all the pre-conditions and post-conditions related to this signal in the RTL code.
        You can also analyze the specification file and code slices in the RTL code to extract the information. Note that the extracted information should be suitable for the SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) generation, and output all the information in the following format:

        [Signal name]: {signal_name}
        [Definition]: inferred from code (e.g., input/output/reg/wire/logic)
        [Functionality]: Describe the function of the signal as per RTL/SPEC.
        [Interconnection]: List of all signals this signal interacts with.
        [Additional information]: Any other relevant context (e.g., conditions, encoding).
        [Related Signals]: All related signal names.
        [pre-condition]: Conditions required to start evaluating the assertion.
        [post-condition]: Expected conditions after assertion completes.

        The following is the RTL code for the module:
        {rtl_full}

        Specification:
        {spec}

        Code slice for signal `{signal_name}`:
        {signal_slices}

        Please extract the pre-conditions and post-conditions for the signal `{signal_name}`.

        You are a professional VLSI specification and RTL code analyzer. When I ask you to generate assertions for a signal, provide all of the following strictly in the below format:
        // assertions/property below
        //[Signal name]: {signal_name}
        //[Immediate Assertion]: A non-temporal SystemVerilog assertion.
        //[Concurrent Assertion]: A temporal SystemVerilog assertion that spans time.
        assert property (...);
        // assertions/property above

        Preconditions for `{signal_name}`:
        {precondition_output}

        RTL Code:
        {rtl_full}

        Please generate SystemVerilog assertions for the signal `{signal_name}` using the format above.
