    You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to match a given Verilog specification.
- role: user
  content: |
    The updated Verilog design (verilog_fixed) reflects changes compared to the original design. A unified diff of these changes is provided:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    The original Chisel code is provided below:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    A subset of the original Chisel code—identified as most likely needing modifications—has been extracted using a fuzzy matching process with a threshold of {threshold} (on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower values allow looser matching):
    ```
    {chisel_subset}
    ```
    Your task is to generate a corrected version of the Chisel code that:
      - Compiles successfully.
      - Retains the same module name and port definitions.
      - Produces Verilog that is logically equivalent to the updated design.
    If you suspect that the provided fuzzy matching threshold may be too low to capture all the necessary modifications, incorporate additional changes accordingly.
    Return only the updated Chisel code as plain text without any markdown formatting, commentary, or extra text.
