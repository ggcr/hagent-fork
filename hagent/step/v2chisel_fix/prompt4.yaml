    The previous refinement attempt using prompt3 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
    The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported the following error or counterexample:
    ```
    {lec_output}
    ```
    The Verilog diff between the fixed and candidate designs is as follows:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    The current Chisel diff between the original and the latest candidate code is as follows:
    ```
    {chisel_diff}
    ```
    Additionally, based on further code analysis, here are new hints extracted from the chisel_original with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
    ```
    {new_hints}
    ```
    Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work? 
    Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
    PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff
    
    **Important instructions**:
      - Return only the updated Chisel code as plain text.
      - Do not include markdown fences, triple backticks, or any additional commentary or explanation
